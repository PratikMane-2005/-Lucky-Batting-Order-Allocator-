"A Python project that assigns a unique random batting order to Gully cricket players."

Lucky Batting Order Allocator is a Python project that randomly assigns a unique batting order to Gully cricket players. The user first enters the number of players and their names, and the program then uses Python’s random module to shuffle and allocate each player a unique batting position. This ensures that no two players get the same order, making the Order fair and unpredictable. It’s a fun and lightweight project that can be used in friendly Gully cricket matches, or just as a randomizer tool for deciding batting sequences.
